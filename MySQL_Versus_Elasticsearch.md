## Elasticsearch:
#### Schema-less or schema-free; documents can have varying structures within the same index.
#### Dynamic mapping allows for automatic field detection.

## MySQL:
#### Requires a predefined schema with a fixed structure for each table.
#### Changes to the schema may require altering tables, which can be a costlier process.
