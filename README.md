## Elasticsearch is a powerful and flexible open-source search and analytics engine.
## It is part of the Elastic Stack (formerly known as ELK Stack), which includes Logstash and Kibana.
## Elasticsearch is designed to handle large volumes of data and to provide near real-time search and analytics capabilities.

## Elasticsearch stores data in a structure known as an index.
## An index in Elasticsearch is similar to a database in a traditional relational database system.
## It contains a collection of documents, and each document is a JSON object.
