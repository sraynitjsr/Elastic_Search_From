#### Elasticsearch is a powerful and flexible open-source search and analytics engine.
#### It is part of the Elastic Stack (formerly known as ELK Stack), which includes Logstash and Kibana.
#### Elasticsearch is designed to handle large volumes of data and to provide near real-time search and analytics capabilities.

#### Elasticsearch stores data in a structure known as an index.
#### An index in Elasticsearch is similar to a database in a traditional relational database system.
#### It contains a collection of documents, and each document is a JSON object.

#### 1. Index:
###### An index is a logical namespace that maps to one or more primary shards and can have zero or more replica shards.
###### It is used to organize and store documents.

#### 2. Document:
###### A document is a JSON object stored in Elasticsearch. It is the basic unit of data.
###### Each document is associated with a unique identifier called the "_id."

#### 3. Field:
###### A document is composed of fields, each of which has a name and a value.
###### Fields can contain various types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and more.

#### 4. Mapping:
###### The mapping defines the schema or structure of the index. It specifies the data type of each field and how it should be indexed and stored.
###### Mapping can be explicit (user-defined) or dynamic (automatically inferred by Elasticsearch).

#### 5. Shard:
###### Elasticsearch uses the concept of shards to horizontally distribute and scale data.
###### Each index is divided into one or more primary shards, and each primary shard may have zero or more replica shards.
###### Shards allow Elasticsearch to distribute the data across nodes in a cluster.

#### 6. Inverted Index:
###### Elasticsearch uses an inverted index for fast full-text search. The inverted index is a data structure that maps terms to the documents containing those terms.
###### This structure allows Elasticsearch to quickly determine which documents match a given query.

#### 7. Segments:
###### Data in Elasticsearch is stored in segments, which are immutable and self-contained units.
###### When new data is added or updated, Elasticsearch creates new segments. These segments are periodically merged to optimize search performance.
