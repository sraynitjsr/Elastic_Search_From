#### Elasticsearch is a powerful and flexible open-source search and analytics engine.
#### It is part of the Elastic Stack (formerly known as ELK Stack), which includes Logstash and Kibana.
#### Elasticsearch is designed to handle large volumes of data and to provide near real-time search and analytics capabilities.

#### Elasticsearch stores data in a structure known as an index.
#### An index in Elasticsearch is similar to a database in a traditional relational database system.
#### It contains a collection of documents, and each document is a JSON object.

#### 1. Index:
###### An index is a logical namespace that maps to one or more primary shards and can have zero or more replica shards.
###### It is used to organize and store documents.

#### 2. Document:
###### A document is a JSON object stored in Elasticsearch. It is the basic unit of data.
###### Each document is associated with a unique identifier called the "_id."
